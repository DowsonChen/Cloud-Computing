There are four folders, each corresponding to one task in order.

For Q1 and Q2 I only put the LoadBalancer.java in folder, for this is the only file which has changes.

For Q3 and Q4 I put whole Maven Project inside. When running I uploaded the project to virtual machine and used mvn complied & exeu to run tasks.

For Q3 and Q4 LoadBalancer.java is changed for sure, I also changed DataCenterInstance.java and Main.java properly, and I added two java files: CreatDc.java and AzureVMApiDemo.java.

No other files were changed.
